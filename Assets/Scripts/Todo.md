# UI

[] Add Return button on equipment screen

# Items

- Make it easier to have drop item by creating a prefab for drop instance items - each weapon inside has different game object children for world combat, dropped or holstered
- Weapon Buffs: Add fire effects prefab to holster weapon effects, then we just change the scale based on a box collider
- No losing gold mechanic - save game saves state. I think its better to simplify. Less confusing to explain.

# AI

- Create behaviour classes for Archers to always prioritze arrows, MAges to always prirotize spells, and so on...
- Create professions. Start with simple Blacksmith Idle which tries to work during hours, and then goes to tavern maybe, then goes to sleep
